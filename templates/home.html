      <p>Here at Sigma Alpha Beta Theaters, we strive to give you the absolute best theater experience metaphysically possible with our current knowledge of the universe. Our movies are only the best movies available, no garbage low budget Amaz*n Prime movies here! This is the real deal baby. We pride ourselves with the fact that all of our movies are ethically made where all staff members are paid a living wage and are not forced to live in "working poverty levels". Our theaters are home to technology brought back by a time traveler who spoke to our founder and explained that movie theaters must not become obsolete. This time traveler was also responsible for the $AMC rise. Please let a customer service representative know if you experience any teleportation.</p>
